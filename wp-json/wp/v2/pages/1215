If you do not consent to the use of your Personal Information in these ways, please stop using the Services.<\/p>\n<h2>Cookies and related technologies<\/h2>\n<p>bluekey uses tracking technology (\u201ccookies\u201d) on the Website, in the Applications, and in the Platforms, including mobile application identifiers and a unique bluekey user ID to help us recognize you across different Services, to monitor usage and web traffic routing for the Services, and to customize and improve the Services. By visiting the Website or using the Services you agree to the use of cookies in your browser and HTML-based emails. Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a web site, in order to track use of the site and to improve your user experience.<\/p>\n<h3>Session Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>The Services use \u201csession cookies\u201d, which improve your user experience by storing certain information from your current visit on your device, such as log-in information. These enable us to remember your log-in session so you can move easily within the Website or the other Services. Without these session cookies, we wouldn\u2019t be able to provide the Services to you. These session cookies have limited functionalities and expirations, and you will be required to re-enter your bluekey log-in information after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents and related Personal Information. Other examples of our use of session cookies include to track the number of visits by a particular visitor to a page and to store items in an online shopping cart for the Shop.<\/p>\n<h3>Performance and Remarketing Cookies<\/h3>\n<p>Partners who help us serve advertising on and off the Website and analytics companies may also put cookies on your device. We use several third-party vendors to help deliver ads for relevant bluekey products and services to you when you visit certain pages on our Website and then visit certain third-party sites. We may share with third-party ad partners a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads and services provided to you. Below is information about one such vendor. Please note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by any third parties.<\/p>\n<h4>i) Google Analytics<\/h4>\n<p>bluekey uses a specific cookie in order to facilitate the use of Google Universal Analytics for users logged-in to the Applications or the Platforms (\u201cLogged-In User). If you are a Logged-In User, bluekey may use your bluekey user ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics to track and analyze the pages of the Services you visit. We do this only to better understand how you use the Website and the other Services, with a view to offering improvements for all bluekey users; and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly, both generally and specifically to you. Google Analytics cookies do not provide bluekey with any Personal Information.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy at Google and to opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.<\/p>\n<h4>ii) Google Display Advertising<\/h4>\n<p>Additionally, bluekey uses Google Analytics code that allows for certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features. Subject to change, the Google Display Advertising features bluekey currently uses are Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.<\/p>\n<p>These features are used to advertise online; to allow third-party vendors, including Google, to show you advertising across the Internet; to allow bluekey and third-party vendors, including Google, to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Website and to report how ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Website. Data from Google\u2019s interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) is also combined with Google Analytics to better understand the needs of bluekey users and to improve the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of such display advertising at any time by visiting your Google Ads Settings page or by installing and running the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on .<\/p>\n<p>bluekey uses other third-party performance and remarketing cookies, and further information on those third-party cookies can be obtained by contacting us.<\/p>\n<p>bluekey may also use related technologies including web beacons, bugs, pixels, and software tokens in order to facilitate your use of the Services. Most notably, the Services use software tokens (stored securely on bluekey-controlled servers) in order to facilitate the logging in to and the functioning of both the Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps.<\/p>\n<p>Most computer and some mobile web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. The Network Advertising Initiative has also developed a tool that may help you understand which third parties have currently enabled cookies for your browser and opt-out of those cookies. Further information can be found at http:\/\/www. networkadvertising.org\/managing\/opt_out.asp. Please note however that, by blocking or deleting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website, Applications, Platforms, and\/or Shop. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.<\/p>\n<h2>When we may share Personal Information<\/h2>\n<p>Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, bluekey does not divulge any Personal Information gathered via the Services (including Customer Content) to third parties.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything in the Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may share any information we have collected about you or Customer Content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) when you explicitly consent to the disclosure of such information to a third party when connecting to a third-party service that asks you if you consent to such sharing;<\/li>\n<li>(2) where we are legally required to do so, such as in response to court orders or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands;<\/li>\n<li>(3) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or personal safety of any person;<\/li>\n<li>(4) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Website infrastructure or the Services generally);<\/li>\n<li>(5) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with bluekey;<\/li>\n<li>(6) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Privacy Policy or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy); and<\/li>\n<li>(7) if this information is not private, is aggregated or is otherwise non-Personal Information, such as your public user profile information and related public data (such as Tweets, likes, etc.) or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did so).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose information to our affiliates, agents, contractors, and service providers in order to facilitate the functioning of the Services or to perform tasks that are integral to the Services, such as processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, or providing support services or other tasks, from time to time. Information may also be transferred from bluekey to the third parties in control of the Supported Platforms, but only to the extent required in order for the Services to function properly.<\/p>\n<h2>Children<\/h2>\n<p>Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us. Our Services should only be accessed by individuals of Minimum Age. \u201cMinimum Age\u201d may mean different ages in different countries, depending on where the individual accesses the services. For reference, \u201cMinimum Age\u201d shall mean (a) 14 years old for the United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and South Korea; and (b) 13 years old for all other countries. However, if applicable law requires that you must be older than such ages in order for bluekey to lawfully provide the Services to you (including the collection, storage, and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy), then the Minimum Age would be such older age. The Services are not designed nor intended for use by children or anyone else under the age of 13.<\/p>\n<h2>Security<\/h2>\n<p>We use industry best practices to keep any information collected and\/or transmitted to the Supported Platforms or Third-Party Apps secure. This includes the use of HTTPS with TLS (Transport Layer Security), which encrypts all transmitted data, and OAuth 2.0 protocols for authentication and data transfer to Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps.<\/p>\n<p>Certain Personal Information, most notably bluekey log-in details, is encrypted during transmission using TLS. Once validated within our system, passwords are deleted from our system. In addition, bluekey uses third-party vendors and hosting partners such as Rapid7 to provide the necessary software and related technology required to run the Services. These vendors have been selected for their high standards of both physical and technological security, including ISO and SSAE16 certifications.<\/p>\n<p>You should bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Services whilst it is in transit over the Internet and any such submission is at your own risk, and this risk is specifically disclaimed in our Terms.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a Logged-in User, it is advisable that you log out of your account at the end of every session and not leave a logged-in account unattended for any period of time, particularly if you use a shared computer or device.<\/p>\n<h2>Your rights<\/h2>\n<p>You can contact us to obtain a copy of the Personal Information held about you by us. This may be subject to a fee not exceeding any prescribed fee permitted by applicable law. You can also ask us to correct and, where relevant, erase that information. Please note that certain Personal Information may need to be retained by bluekey for a period of time following cancellation of your account where this is necessary for our legitimate business purposes or required or authorized by applicable law. As mentioned above you have a right to change your email preferences at any time.<\/p>\n<p>You should be aware that bluekey acts as a conduit between our users and the various Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps. In several instances, the content that has been shared by you through any Supported Platform or Third-Party Apps via the Services may continue to be available to third parties and the public at large, as this content is now under the control of the operators of the Supported Platforms and\/or the Third-Party Apps.<\/p>\n<h2>Contacting us<\/h2>\n<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact: support@bluekey.com<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>bluekey Privacy Policy Effective date: March 3rd, 2018 Introduction bluekey Inc. and its affiliates are committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals who: visit any websites or mobile sites offered by bluekey, including without limitation bluekey.com, and including all subdomains, present and future (the \u201cWebsite\u201d);
